								<p>[This session was held online in Discord] 
								It is interesting how the two games build on each other to build a complex and brutal story in the post apocalyptic setting. The last of us 2 uses game mechanics and storytelling to illustrate the cycle of violence. The evolution of minigame like the guitar playing mini through points of the games is also used to convey emotions of loss and healing.</p>

								The turn-based strategy genre have a wild range of specific mechanics. These two games both use the cover system, but one gives significantly more control to the player. We also discussed how one genre can have many stylistic extremes, with Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle also using similar mechanics.</p>

								<p>[This session was held online in Discord] 
								With both games relying heavily on colour coding, too much colours could result in potential noise for game. Differences in the gameplay experience led to a debate on the utility of a small cast of characters vs a larger one. We observed that Ori's more flowy controls match its larger (scaled to character) areas and the knight's precise controls to a smaller area. Finally, we examined how the two games links their health system to other mechanics. Namely magic vs saving and magic. </p>

								Despite the lack of graphics , sounds and feedback, these web games are still captivating and engaging to the audience. As text-based real-time idle games, we discussed how new players might not be patient enough to wait for new progress. Due to its limited medium, the lack of feedback in combat for these games were also a factor that decreased its attractiveness to players now.</p>

The abstract world of Gris allows for a much lighter cognitive load than the action-packed, colourful world of transistor-- each art style and game mechanic suiting their individual emotional landscape. We also exchanged thoughts on the two game's endings and our own experiences playing these games. In conclusion, Gris is a relaxing game with tense moments, while transistor is a tense game with relaxing moments.</p>

As we look closely at the techniques these games employ to increase their replay value, we also discussed how we might improve or change these games to make them more repayable.</p>

								<p>[This session was held online in Discord] Thomas was alone implored us to examine how an interesting narration can make us invested in the most simplest of character sprites. While the portrayal of female characters in the game has room for improvement, each of the cubic characters are fleshed out well through their abilities and their thoughts. As a puzzle platformer, the game has small accessibility issues and slightly unbalanced difficulty, giving rise to our discussion of how we could improve the game to allow different skill levels to complete such a game.</p>

								<p>Undertale, the intrnational sensation. We discussed how Undertale wins the hearts of so many players with its great sotrytelling and compelling music. Even while it's gameplay may not be for everyone, it's whismical and unique narrative tone is consistently loved by a great number of people. It truly is an insiprational game, not just through its contents, but also through the meta narrative of a single person, working mostly by himself, being able to bring an entire world to life through successfuly creating such an expansive game.</p>

							<p>Diving into the beautiful world that is Abzu, we examined the use of symbols, lighting and leading lines in level design and storytelling.

							<p>We explore the original real-time strategy game that started the entire genre and introduced new ways to integrate storytelling with gameplay. While we spent time criticising the limited pathfinding capabilities of this classic, the game also gave us an opportunity  appreciate how technology has improved through our lifetime.</p>

							<p>Our first lab session examining a mobile game, ThatSkyGame brought us a journey through cloud shaders, crunchy grass sound effects and slightly troublesome one-handed controls. We discussed the choices made for the game to be mobile and multiplayer, as well as how it might function as a walking simulator instead.</p>

							</section>

							<p>We examined this classic for all its firsts in video game history, such as its extensive use of environmental storytelling, lack of cutscene and interactability with physics objects in game. We also spent time appreciating the signposting in the game, where lit areas lead the player towards their next objective. From the occasional trouble the new players in our session faced, there were still some unresolved pathfinding issues in the game.</p>

							<p>This walking simulator brought us a journey through the intricacies of level design, detailed modeling and storytelling. Within the studio session, we managed to complete most of the game. Most of us were extremely taken by how well the level is designed, such that even diverging paths are hidden from view; only to be seen when viewed at a specific angle in game.</p>

							<p>We explored reasons for the longevity of the Rogue-like genre of games, examining the crucial aspects of games in the genre and how it incorporates forms of progression even while keeping the randomised enemy rooms. We also spent time appreciating the aesthetics of Hades, with its clear colour coded enemy types and telegraphing.</p>

							<p>We took a deep dive into the graphics system for the creation of campfires and smoke in the legend of zelda game: breath of the wild. We also held a spirited discussion over the various technical exploits used to speedrun the game, and others like it; such as, using the resetting of 3D character models during equipment swap to shift sprite position into outofbounds.</p>

								<p>We spent a relaxing afternoon discussing unconventional game types and why the Untitled goose game managed to capture the hearts of so many gamers. We also spent some time in overcooked, experiencing for ourselves the phenomenon of going into the "zone", a state of high concentration that any competitive gamers cite as a state of high concentration and performance.</p>
