							After a few weeks of indie games, we return to a triple A franchise. With it's atmospheric music and gritty shaders, we discussed the use of the Batman IP within the game world, as well as overused comic book cliches in game. With the game's extensive amount of content and unique mechanics, it is hard to find any fault in such a game made with as much time, effort and love as Batman: Arkham Knight.</p>

								<p>[This session was held online in Discord] Thomas was alone implored us to examine how an interesting narration can make us invested in the most simplest of character sprites. While the portrayal of female characters in the game has room for improvement, each of the cubic characters are fleshed out well through their abilities and their thoughts. As a puzzle platformer, the game has small accessibility issues and slightly unbalanced difficulty, giving rise to our discussion of how we could improve the game to allow different skill levels to complete such a game.</p>

								<p>Undertale, the intrnational sensation. We discussed how Undertale wins the hearts of so many players with its great sotrytelling and compelling music. Even while it's gameplay may not be for everyone, it's whismical and unique narrative tone is consistently loved by a great number of people. It truly is an insiprational game, not just through its contents, but also through the meta narrative of a single person, working mostly by himself, being able to bring an entire world to life through successfuly creating such an expansive game.</p>

							<p>We examined this classic for all its firsts in video game history, such as its extensive use of environmental storytelling, lack of cutscene and interactability with physics objects in game. We also spent time appreciating the signposting in the game, where lit areas lead the player towards their next objective. From the occasional trouble the new players in our session faced, there were still some unresolved pathfinding issues in the game.</p>

							<p>This walking simulator brought us a journey through the intricacies of level design, detailed modeling and storytelling. Within the studio session, we managed to complete most of the game. Most of us were extremely taken by how well the level is designed, such that even diverging paths are hidden from view; only to be seen when viewed at a specific angle in game.</p>

							<p>We explored reasons for the longevity of the Rogue-like genre of games, examining the crucial aspects of games in the genre and how it incorporates forms of progression even while keeping the randomised enemy rooms. We also spent time appreciating the aesthetics of Hades, with its clear colour coded enemy types and telegraphing.</p>

We also held a spirited discussion over the various technical exploits used to speedrun the game, and others like it; such as, using the resetting of 3D character models during equipment swap to shift sprite position into outofbounds.</p>

								<p>We spent a relaxing afternoon discussing unconventional game types and why the Untitled goose game managed to capture the hearts of so many gamers. We also spent some time in overcooked, experiencing for ourselves the phenomenon of going into the "zone", a state of high concentration that any competitive gamers cite as a state of high concentration and performance.</p>
